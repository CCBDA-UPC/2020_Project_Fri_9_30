## Functionalities

**1. Simulation of people's behavior and infection spread**

Basically, people in a particular area are represented by dots with different colors which indicate their health status. The coordinates of these dots depend on the locations of people and how they are moving based on individual daily agenda. These following factors can be specified by users via parameters.
- People: professions, daily agenda, transportation,...
- Infection characteristics: transmission rate, duration of the incubation stage, mortality percentage,...

**2. Simulation with Contact Tracing System based on the proposal from Apple and Google**

We are going to implement a simplified Contact Tracing System to keep track of people who have been recently in contact with an infected person. We then take some measures, for example, self-quarantined and specify it in the simulation to see the changes in infection rate whether it goes down or not.

## Scopes

This project aims at developing infection simulating and contact tracing services to evaluate and decide which measures should be taken to stop people from getting infected with coronavirus  

- Deliverables: Infection Simulating and contact tracing service
- Customers & Stakeholders: Government, Citizens, ...
- Duration: 5 weeks
- Development methods: Agile
